Specialized models for legal documents:

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Legal document classification
legal_classifier = pipeline(
    "zero-shot-classification"
)

legal_documents = [
    "The parties hereby agree to arbitrate all disputes arising under this agreement.",
    "Tenant shall maintain liability insurance in the amount of $1,000,000.",
    "This agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York."
]

categories = ["Arbitration Clause", "Insurance Requirement", "Governing Law", "Termination Provision"]

for doc in legal_documents:
    result = legal_classifier(doc, categories)
    print(f"Text: {doc}")
    print(f"Classification: {result['labels'][0]} (Score: {result['scores'][0]:.4f})")
    print("-" * 50)
```
